## [Unreleased]

The first pre-alpha release (`0.0.1`) will ship the initial public API surface. The package begins
its public history at `0.0.x`, per the cosyte version ladder (`0.0.x` until first alpha).

### Added

- **Phase 1 — the ConceptMap `$translate` engine + code-system identity/canonical-URI resolver**
  (`TERMINOLOGY-1`). This replaces the parser-shaped scaffold stubs: `@cosyte/terminology` is a
  **terminology engine** modeled on the FHIR Terminology Module, not a wire parser.
  - **Code-system identity resolver** — `resolveSystem(id)` maps a canonical URI, OID (bare or
    `urn:oid:`), or HL7 v2 mnemonic to a single `SystemIdentity` (canonical URI + OID + mnemonics), or
    a typed `{ unknown }` — never a guessed URI. Seeded with identities grounded **firsthand** against
    the FHIR R4 terminology-systems registry and HL7 Table 0396: LOINC, SNOMED CT, ICD-10-CM, RxNorm,
    UCUM, CPT, NDC, CVX, and the HL7 v2 table family (`v2-XXXX` URI ↔ `…12.[table]` OID, resolved
    structurally). Exposed as `SYSTEM_IDENTITIES`, `HL7_V2_OID_ROOT`, `HL7_V2_URL_PREFIX`.
  - **ConceptMap `$translate` engine** — `loadConceptMap(json)` validates an untrusted FHIR R4
    `ConceptMap` into an immutable model (malformed → typed fatal `TERM_CONCEPTMAP_MALFORMED`);
    `translate(coding, map)` returns the declared target(s) with their FHIR relationship (an internal
    R5-vocabulary `Relationship` plus the verbatim R4 `equivalence`), steward comments, and the map's
    provenance — or a typed `unmapped` result carrying any `group.unmapped` fallback mode.
  - **The never-fabricate / never-invert invariants** (the safety crown for every later phase): an
    unmapped source is surfaced, never a guessed target; a directional map is read source→target only
    and never inverted. Locked by property-based tests.
  - **Value types + diagnostics**: immutable `coding()` / `codeableConcept()`; untrusted-JSON
    navigation helpers (`isJsonObject`/`getString`/`getArray`); the stable, value-free
    `DIAGNOSTIC_CODES` (`TERM_TRANSLATE_UNMAPPED`, `TERM_SYSTEM_UNRECOGNIZED`) + `FATAL_CODES`
    (`TERM_CONCEPTMAP_MALFORMED`) registries and the typed `TerminologyError`.
  - **Zero runtime dependencies** retained; **zero bundled copyrighted terminology content**
    (SNOMED/CPT/full-LOINC/UMLS/VSAC are BYO by license).

### Changed

### Deprecated

### Removed

- The parser-shaped scaffold stubs (`parseTerminology`, `ParsedTerminology`, the placeholder
  `WARNING_CODES` entry, and the parse-oriented option/warning types). This package is an engine, not
  a parser; that placeholder surface never shipped.
