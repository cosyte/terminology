## [Unreleased]

The first pre-alpha release (`0.0.1`) will ship the initial public API surface. The package begins
its public history at `0.0.x`, per the cosyte version ladder (`0.0.x` until first alpha).

### Added

- **Phase 2 — the CodeSystem load layer + FHIR `$lookup` / `$validate-code`** (`TERMINOLOGY-2`).
  Loads a **consumer-supplied** code-system release into an immutable, queryable model and answers the
  two FHIR R4 CodeSystem identity operations. Ships the engine only — **zero bundled copyrighted
  content** (RxNorm/LOINC/ICD-10-CM/SNOMED/CPT releases are BYO).
  - **`loadCodeSystem(source)`** — one entry point over four hand-rolled, zero-dep readers, dispatched
    on `source.format`: **RRF** (pipe-delimited, single trailing pipe; one parameterized reader for
    RxNorm `RXNCONSO` and UMLS `MRCONSO`), **RFC-4180 CSV** (real quote handling — LOINC `Loinc.csv`),
    **fixed-width** (slice-by-column order files; `ICD10CM_ORDER_FILE_FIELDS` preset with the
    position-15 header/billable flag), and native **FHIR R4 `CodeSystem` JSON** (nested-concept
    flattening, standard `inactive`/`deprecated`/`status` properties). Liberal on load: a malformed
    row is skipped and surfaced in `warnings` (`TERM_RRF_MALFORMED_ROW` / `TERM_CSV_MALFORMED` /
    `TERM_FIXED_WIDTH_MALFORMED` / `TERM_FHIR_CONCEPT_MALFORMED`); a structurally unusable _source_ is
    the typed fatal `TERM_CODESYSTEM_MALFORMED`.
  - **`lookup(cs, code)`** — FHIR `$lookup`: code → display + definition + properties, carrying a
    `ConceptStatus` (deprecated / header-not-billable / obsolete / suppressed, with `active` and, for
    ICD-10-CM, `billable`). An unknown code is a typed `{ found: false }` — never a fabricated display.
  - **`validateCode(cs, code)`** — FHIR `$validate-code`: `valid: true` for a present code **carrying
    its status** (a deprecated or header code validates as present but is flagged, never presented
    clean); an absent code is `valid: false` with `TERM_CODE_UNKNOWN` — never a guessed `true`.
  - **The never-fabricate invariant extends to code identity** — locked by property-based +
    fuzz tests (the RRF/CSV/fixed-width readers never crash on hostile input; a lookup display always
    comes verbatim from the loaded release). Grounded firsthand on FHIR R4
    (`codesystem-operation-lookup`/`-validate-code`, concept-properties).
  - New value-free stable codes: `TERM_CODE_UNKNOWN`, `TERM_CONCEPT_DEPRECATED`,
    `TERM_CONCEPT_HEADER_NOT_BILLABLE`, `TERM_RRF_MALFORMED_ROW`, `TERM_CSV_MALFORMED`,
    `TERM_FIXED_WIDTH_MALFORMED`, `TERM_FHIR_CONCEPT_MALFORMED` (diagnostics) and
    `TERM_CODESYSTEM_MALFORMED` (fatal). New JSON helpers `getBoolean` / `getNumber`.
  - **Zero runtime dependencies** retained.

- **Phase 1 — the ConceptMap `$translate` engine + code-system identity/canonical-URI resolver**
  (`TERMINOLOGY-1`). This replaces the parser-shaped scaffold stubs: `@cosyte/terminology` is a
  **terminology engine** modeled on the FHIR Terminology Module, not a wire parser.
  - **Code-system identity resolver** — `resolveSystem(id)` maps a canonical URI, OID (bare or
    `urn:oid:`), or HL7 v2 mnemonic to a single `SystemIdentity` (canonical URI + OID + mnemonics), or
    a typed `{ unknown }` — never a guessed URI. Seeded with identities grounded **firsthand** against
    the FHIR R4 terminology-systems registry and HL7 Table 0396: LOINC, SNOMED CT, ICD-10-CM, RxNorm,
    UCUM, CPT, NDC, CVX, and the HL7 v2 table family (`v2-XXXX` URI ↔ `…12.[table]` OID, resolved
    structurally). Exposed as `SYSTEM_IDENTITIES`, `HL7_V2_OID_ROOT`, `HL7_V2_URL_PREFIX`.
  - **ConceptMap `$translate` engine** — `loadConceptMap(json)` validates an untrusted FHIR R4
    `ConceptMap` into an immutable model (malformed → typed fatal `TERM_CONCEPTMAP_MALFORMED`);
    `translate(coding, map)` returns the declared target(s) with their FHIR relationship (an internal
    R5-vocabulary `Relationship` plus the verbatim R4 `equivalence`), steward comments, and the map's
    provenance — or a typed `unmapped` result carrying any `group.unmapped` fallback mode.
  - **The never-fabricate / never-invert invariants** (the safety crown for every later phase): an
    unmapped source is surfaced, never a guessed target; a directional map is read source→target only
    and never inverted. Locked by property-based tests.
  - **Value types + diagnostics**: immutable `coding()` / `codeableConcept()`; untrusted-JSON
    navigation helpers (`isJsonObject`/`getString`/`getArray`); the stable, value-free
    `DIAGNOSTIC_CODES` (`TERM_TRANSLATE_UNMAPPED`, `TERM_SYSTEM_UNRECOGNIZED`) + `FATAL_CODES`
    (`TERM_CONCEPTMAP_MALFORMED`) registries and the typed `TerminologyError`.
  - **Zero runtime dependencies** retained; **zero bundled copyrighted terminology content**
    (SNOMED/CPT/full-LOINC/UMLS/VSAC are BYO by license).

### Changed

### Deprecated

### Removed

- The parser-shaped scaffold stubs (`parseTerminology`, `ParsedTerminology`, the placeholder
  `WARNING_CODES` entry, and the parse-oriented option/warning types). This package is an engine, not
  a parser; that placeholder surface never shipped.

### Fixed

### Security
