/**
 * `@cosyte/terminology` PHI scanner — the CI / pre-commit half of the PHI commit-gate.
 *
 * Pure Node. Zero runtime deps. `git` is the only subprocess, always via
 * `execFileSync` with array args (never shell-form). Walks the synthetic test
 * fixtures (and a conservative text pass over `src/`) and REFUSES anything that
 * looks like real PHI, so a developer cannot commit a real-looking fixture by
 * accident.
 *
 * ===========================================================================
 * ██  STARTER — READ BEFORE YOU RELY ON THIS  ███████████████████████████████
 * ===========================================================================
 *
 *   This file is the SHARED MACHINERY only. As shipped it detects EXACTLY TWO
 *   cross-cutting PHI shapes that apply to ANY format:
 *
 *       (1) a dashed Social Security Number   (\d{3}-\d{2}-\d{4})
 *       (2) an email at a non-test domain
 *
 *   That is a FLOOR, not a gate. It does NOT understand Terminology. It will NOT
 *   catch a patient name, a date of birth, an MRN / member id, an address, or a
 *   phone number sitting in a structured Terminology field — the PHI that a real
 *   Terminology message actually carries.
 *
 *   ⚠  A scanner that silently ships SSN/email-only detection is a FALSE-
 *      CONFIDENCE RISK: it reports green on fixtures stuffed with real names and
 *      DOBs. Before you trust `pnpm phi-scan` as a safety gate for Terminology,
 *      YOU MUST add structured, field-level detection for THIS standard's PHI
 *      (names, DOB, MRN / member id, address, phone) in the clearly-fenced
 *      TODO section inside `scanTarget` below.
 *
 *   Worked examples of structured, format-aware detection live in the sibling
 *   parsers — read one before you start:
 *       ../hl7/scripts/phi-scan.ts     (segment → field → component aware)
 *       ../x12/scripts/phi-scan.ts     (ISA-delimited NM1 / DMG / PER aware)
 *       ../dicom/scripts/phi-scan.ts   (binary tag-aware)
 *       ../ccda/scripts/phi-scan.ts    (XML element aware)
 *       ../ncpdp/scripts/phi-scan.ts   (fixed-field aware)
 *
 *   The mechanism for declaring genuinely-synthetic identifiers is the
 *   allow-list (`scripts/phi-allow-list.txt`) — a positive declaration that a
 *   fixture's identifiers are fake. Byte-strict formats cannot carry an inline
 *   `# synthetic: true` header, so the allow-list is the proven substitute
 *   (same approach every sibling uses). A whole-file bypass needs
 *   `--allow-fixture <path>` AND a logged entry in `phi-scan-overrides.md`.
 * ===========================================================================
 *
 * Modes:
 *   --staged                 - scan only files staged in `git diff --cached`
 *   --allow-fixture <path>   - bypass one path; rejected unless logged in
 *                              phi-scan-overrides.md
 *   <path> [<path>...]       - scan specific paths
 *   (no args)                - scan all in-scope working-tree files
 *
 * Exit codes: 0 (clean), 1 (hits found), 2 (invocation error).
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * AN IN-SCOPE ENTRY THAT IS NOT A REGULAR FILE REFUSES THE SCAN (exit 2). It is
 * never silently skipped, because BOTH enumerating routes are blind to it in a
 * way that reads as clean:
 *
 *   - the walk enumerates `Dirent.isFile()`, which is an lstat answer, so a
 *     symbolic link is neither a file nor a directory and used to fall out of
 *     the loop silently, whatever it pointed at;
 *   - `--staged` reads content with `git show :<path>`, and git stores a
 *     symbolic link as its TARGET PATH under mode 120000, so that route is
 *     handed the path text and never the target's bytes.
 *
 * So a link under a scan root pointing at a PHI-bearing file scanned CLEAN on
 * both. Neither route is made to follow it: following would read bytes the
 * enumeration does not control (outside the repo, a loop, a device, a FIFO that
 * blocks the gate forever), and git does not carry those bytes anyway, so a hit
 * on them would be a claim about something no commit contains. Refusing states
 * the only true thing available: there is an entry here the scan cannot account
 * for, so the scan is not clean.
 *
 * "In scope" for the walk is its own existing boundary, not a new one: it still
 * excludes a gitignored entry (the same rule that already excludes a gitignored
 * file, so links do not get a second, stricter boundary of their own).
 *
 * `--staged` looks at `test/fixtures/**` and `src/**.ts` PLUS each root's own
 * path (`test/fixtures` and `src`). FOUR PLACES IT NOW ADMITS **MORE** THAN IT
 * ONCE DID, called out rather than folded into "narrowing", because all four
 * change what it enumerates: rename detection is OFF, so a rename or copy
 * destination arrives as an ordinary add instead of vanishing with its two-path
 * record; an UNMERGED path is enumerated so it can be REFUSED instead of passed
 * over in silence; each scan root's OWN path (`test/fixtures`, `src`) is in
 * scope, so an entry replacing one of exactly those two paths is judged instead
 * of skipped — a root's PARENT is still invisible to both routes, PRE-EXISTING
 * and out of scope here; and submodule records are asked for
 * explicitly, so a staged gitlink survives a caller's `diff.ignoreSubmodules`.
 * Each is measured at `buildTargetsForStaged`.
 *
 * A refusal names the entry's own repo-relative path and an engine-owned token
 * for its kind. IT NEVER REPORTS THE LINK TARGET, which is text off the working
 * tree and can itself carry PHI — a target path of the shape
 * `../patients/<surname>-<given>-<dob>.txt` is the whole reason. The shape is
 * written out rather than an example, because a diagnostic ABOUT a PHI leak is
 * itself a PHI surface, and that applies to the prose explaining it too.

    // Turning detection off costs NO STRIDE WORK: the destination arrives as an

    // two-path record shape handled, which is a scope decision" framing this
    // route carried is WITHDRAWN, not deferred again — it was measured false.

    // STRUCTURAL rather than conditional on the caller's configuration. State the
    // resulting relation exactly, because its loose form was refuted in a sibling.
    // OF THIS FLAG ALONE, holding the rest of the argv fixed: the new enumeration
    // CONTAINS the old one — EQUAL whenever git emitted no `R` and no `C`, larger
    // only when it did. It is a superset, not a strictly larger set, and nothing
    // the old argv enumerated stops being enumerated. The whole-argv change is
    // larger still, because `U` and the gitlink records below are added too, so do
    // not read that equality as a statement about the argv as a whole.
    //
    // THE `C` HALF IS REAL AND NO RENAME FIXTURE REACHES IT. Under
    // `diff.renames=copies`, copying an out-of-scope PHI-bearing file INTO a scan
    // root staged as a genuine `C100` two-path record and was dropped exactly as a
    // rename was (measured: exit 0 before, exit 1 after). One precondition, easy
    // to state too broadly: config-only copy detection also needs the COPY SOURCE
    // modified in the same staged diff. Without that git finds no copy source, the
    // record arrives as an ordinary `A` that even the old argv enumerated, and a
    // naive copy fixture passes on both scanners while proving nothing.
    //
    // `U` (UNMERGED) IS IN THE FILTER SO IT CAN BE REFUSED, NOT SCANNED, AND IT IS
    // CLOSED BY A DIFFERENT MECHANISM THAN THE ONE ABOVE — the two must not be
    // conflated. `U` is closed by being IN `--diff-filter=AMTU`; `--no-renames`
    // does not carry it, and dropping `U` from the filter on the belief that the
    // flag covers it re-opens the gap. It was returned by neither `AM` nor `AMT`,
    // so a conflicted in-scope path made this route print its clean line over an
    // index it structurally cannot read (measured, exit 0, with a dashed-SSN shape
    // sitting in one of the stages). Git itself refuses to commit while a path is
    // unmerged, so this was never a route to a committed leak; what it was is the
    // gate attesting clean over a state it never observed, and
    // `pnpm phi-scan --staged` is run by hand and from scripts as well as from the
    // hook. `U` carries a single path like `A`/`M`/`T`, so it costs the stride
    // nothing either.
    //
    // `--ignore-submodules=none` BECAUSE THE CALLER'S CONFIG COULD OTHERWISE
    // DELETE A RECORD THIS ROUTE ALREADY REFUSES. With `diff.ignoreSubmodules=all`
    // set, a staged gitlink under a scan root vanished from the output entirely and
    // this route printed its clean line (measured: exit 2 on the default, exit 0
    // with that config, same index). Same remedy family as `--no-renames`: state
    // the enumeration on the command line rather than inheriting it.
    //
    // THE STRIDE BELOW IS COUPLED TO THIS ARGV, so read the coupling before
    // editing it. `--no-renames` is what makes a two-path record impossible, and
    // `-M`, `-C` and `--find-copies-harder` each turn detection back on over the
    // top of it: measured on a real rename stage, every one of the three empties
    // this route again. Do not add them.
    //
    // `-B` IS NOT SAFE EITHER, AND A FIRST DRAFT OF THIS COMMENT CALLED IT INERT.
    // That reading was taken from a RENAME stage — the one stage where it does
    // nothing — and it is false in the direction that blinds the gate. `-B` breaks
    // the pairing on a COMPLETE REWRITE, whose `--diff-filter` letter is `B` and
    // not `M`, so `AMTU` drops the record outright: measured, exit 1 over a staged
    // dashed SSN without the flag and exit 0 with it, on the same index. It
    // empties this route through the status FILTER rather than by re-enabling
    // detection, which is a different mechanism and the same answer — do not add
    // it. A sibling repository ships the "inert" claim; it is wrong there too.

  //   detection for Terminology's PHI — at minimum: person NAMES, DATE OF BIRTH,
  //   MRN / MEMBER ID, ADDRESS, and PHONE — parsing `text` according to the
  //   Terminology wire format and checking each PHI-bearing field against the
  //   allow-list (`allow.names` / `allow.dobs` / `allow.ids`), pushing a `Hit`
  //   for anything not positively declared synthetic.
  //
  //   Parse the format properly (delimiters / segments / elements / tags) — do
  //   NOT bolt on a blind text regex for names: coded values (`CBC^Complete
  //   Blood Count`, `Boston^MA`) produce false confidence. See the sibling
  //   parsers named in the STARTER banner at the top of this file for worked,
  //   spec-aware examples you can adapt:
  //
  //     const d = detectTerminologyDelimiters(text);          // if applicable
  //     for (const record of splitTerminology(text, d)) {
  //       // check name / dob / id / address / phone fields against `allow`
  //       // hits.push({ path: target.path, segment: "<field>", value, reason });

  //   "no SSN/email shapes found" — NOT as "no PHI".
