/**
 * scripts/check-agent-notes.mjs: the two-file contract between THIS repo's `CLAUDE.md`
 * and THIS repo's `documentation/agent-notes.md`, checked.
 *
 * WHAT THE CONTRACT IS. The 2026-08-04 split moved this repo's narrative out of the
 * always-read `CLAUDE.md` into a long-form record read on demand. Both halves state the
 * same promise in their own words: `CLAUDE.md` says each line is an imperative and the
 * pointer after it is the incident and the measurement behind it, and the record's
 * preamble says `CLAUDE.md` keeps a one-line imperative for each and points at the
 * heading here. Nothing checked it. A worker following a pointer that no longer resolves
 * gets the imperative and none of the reasoning, which is the exact failure the split was
 * supposed to be safe against: the imperatives here are clinical-safety lessons about a
 * terminology engine (an inverted crosswalk, a fabricated target, a mis-keyed unit memo),
 * and the record says in its own preamble that a summary of one is not a substitute for
 * it. A heading reworded here silently strands every pointer at it, and neither file gets
 * a compile error.
 *
 * THIS GATE IS SCOPED TO THIS REPO, DELIBERATELY, AND IS NAMED FOR WHAT IT CHECKS. The
 * split landed across the fleet, but the contract is NOT universal and this gate must not
 * claim it is: several cosyte repos carry no `documentation/agent-notes.md` at all, so a
 * gate asserting "every cosyte repo carries one" would be an overclaim that repos already
 * break. NO LIST AND NO COUNT IS WRITTEN HERE, and neither should be: the set moves as
 * repos gain the record, and a copy of it here cannot self-correct. Derive it, from the
 * meta-repo checkout, never from prose:
 *
 *   for d in $(git submodule status | awk '{print $2}'); do
 *     [ -e "$d/documentation/agent-notes.md" ] || echo "$d"; done
 *
 * What this file asserts is what `terminology` itself promises, in `terminology`'s own CI,
 * which is also why it costs the meta-repo's capped automation plane nothing.
 *
 * WHERE THE TEETH ARE. This script is invocable as `pnpm check:agent-notes`, but the
 * blocking path is `test/scripts/agent-notes.test.ts`, which runs it. That is a choice,
 * not an accident: a required job gates all of its STEPS, so a check placed inside the
 * `ci / verify` matrix blocks a merge for as long as that matrix is required, with no
 * ruleset change of its own. A fourth workflow would have been a new context, and a
 * context is requireable only once its workflow has completed on `main`, which is a
 * ruleset change this repo cannot observe from inside itself. Reporting is not gating.
 * WHICH CONTEXTS ARE REQUIRED IS DELIBERATELY NOT WRITTEN DOWN HERE: read the live answer
 * with `gh api repos/cosyte/terminology/rulesets`, never from prose.
 *
 * THE POINTER FORMS ARE MEASURED AGAINST THIS TREE, NOT INHERITED FROM A SIBLING. This is
 * the defect this gate class keeps producing: a sibling's gate was ported verbatim into a
 * repo whose dominant spelling was different, and it printed "all resolving" while
 * covering a small minority of that repo's pointers. A gate that reports success over a
 * corpus it never matched is worse than no gate. So the forms here were counted first:
 *
 *   1. THE LIVE FORM IN THIS TREE is the BARE one: the record's BASENAME, then a `#`, then
 *      the anchor, with no `documentation/` in front of it. Every pointer in this
 *      repository is written that way today. No count is written here, because the gate
 *      prints one on every run and a numeral in a comment is the staleness class this repo
 *      keeps paying for.
 *   2. THE PATH-QUALIFIED form (the record's full path, then `#`, then the anchor) is what
 *      the sibling repos write and what a copy-paste from one of them produces. This tree
 *      has none today. It is matched anyway, so a pointer written in the sibling spelling
 *      is checked from its first day rather than being invisible.
 *
 * Both forms are scanned in EVERY tracked file, so a pointer written into `README.md` or a
 * source comment is covered without this file declaring a root. Neither pattern is written
 * out here as a literal: both are built from the path constants at run time, so this file
 * never contains a pointer of its own and needs no self-exemption. The em-dash gate next
 * door has to hold itself to its own rule the same way, and a sibling's self-exclusion is
 * a measured false green.
 *
 * WHAT IT REFUSES TO GUESS. Every one of these exits 2 and prints CANNOT CHECK.
 *
 *  - A CHECK CAN PRINT GREEN OVER A CORPUS IT NEVER OPENED, and a denominator does not
 *    detect it: a count counts the files that DID exist. So the corpus is enumerated from
 *    `git ls-files` and RECONCILED as sets: every tracked path is opened, or the run
 *    refuses. THERE IS NO BINARY SKIP, NO NUL SKIP AND NO OTHER EXEMPTION, so on a clean
 *    run the read count EQUALS the tracked count and there is no residue for a reader to
 *    interpret. Do not add one: a sibling's gate skips NUL-bearing files and has to
 *    disclose the miss, and this repository's own em-dash gate records that a NUL
 *    partition would skip a prose-bearing UTF-8 source in silence. A tracked file missing
 *    from the worktree is a refusal, not a silent skip, because a gate cannot claim to
 *    cover a file it could not read.
 *  - Both files the contract is about must be present in what was actually opened. A
 *    phantom path cannot yield green here, because green requires having read them.
 *  - FINDING ZERO POINTERS IS A REFUSAL. An empty result set is indistinguishable from a
 *    clean run by any count. Same net `scripts/attw.mjs` carries for a tool that exits 0
 *    having printed nothing.
 *  - FINDING ZERO POINTERS IN THE LIVE (BARE) FORM IS ALSO A REFUSAL, even when the
 *    path-qualified form still matches. That is the tripwire for the ported-matcher defect
 *    above: this tree's pointers are written bare, so a run that matches none of them is
 *    either a scanner that stopped matching or a migration nobody told this gate about.
 *    Both need a human, and neither may read as clean. The converse is NOT a refusal:
 *    zero path-qualified pointers is the normal state here, and that asymmetry is measured
 *    rather than assumed.
 *  - A heading carrying a non-ASCII character is a refusal rather than a guess. The
 *    slugifier below reproduces GitHub's ASCII behaviour; on anything else it would
 *    silently compute the wrong anchor, and a wrong anchor reads as a broken pointer or,
 *    worse, resolves to the wrong section.
 *
 * THE ENCODING LIMIT, PINNED IN BOTH DIRECTIONS RATHER THAN ASSUMED. Every tracked file is
 * decoded as UTF-8. The pointer patterns are pure ASCII and UTF-8 decoding replaces only
 * INVALID sequences, resyncing at the next valid byte, so an ASCII run inside an otherwise
 * non-UTF-8 file survives intact: a pointer in a Windows-1252 file IS matched, pinned by
 * test. The rule in the other direction is exactly one sentence long, and do not restate it
 * as a list of encodings: A POINTER IS MATCHED IF AND ONLY IF THE FILE SPELLS THE ANCHOR IN
 * ITS ASCII BYTES. A UTF-16 file does not, and that miss is pinned too. An encoding that
 * happens to (UTF-7 may encode `#` directly, and then it does) is matched. Naming
 * encodings instead of the rule is how the first draft of this paragraph got UTF-7 wrong.
 * The miss is disclosed rather than closed, and it is cheap here: every source in this
 * repository is UTF-8 by toolchain, and a miss can only ever hide a pointer, never invent
 * one.
 *
 * WHAT THIS GATE DOES NOT ASSERT, said plainly so nobody reads more into a green run:
 *
 *  - Not that any other repo has an `agent-notes.md`. See the scope note above.
 *  - Not that every trap in `CLAUDE.md` has a pointer. Recognising "a trap" is a judgement
 *    about prose; a guard that tried would be the universal-shaped overclaim this file is
 *    written to avoid. The class it cannot see is the trap phrased as a deliberate
 *    omission, which carries no identifier to grep for.
 *  - Not that a section's prose is accurate, current, or that the trap it describes is
 *    closed. A pointer is not a closure.
 *  - Not that every heading is pointed at. An unreferenced section is legitimate.
 *  - Not that a heading it counted renders as one. A heading inside an HTML comment is
 *    counted here and produces no anchor on GitHub, so a pointer at it would resolve here
 *    and go nowhere there. The record contains no HTML comment today, so this is a latent
 *    limit rather than a live one; it is disclosed rather than guarded, because the guard
 *    would be a second markdown implementation and the disclosure is what was missing.
 *  - Not GitHub's duplicate-anchor suffixing beyond the `-1`, `-2` sequence below, and no
 *    other link target in the repo. This is not a link checker.
 *
 * THERE IS NO EXCLUSION LIST, so no skip can quietly go phantom. One hazard follows: DO
 * NOT WRITE A POINTER INTO A CHANGESET SUMMARY. The summary becomes the `CHANGELOG.md`
 * entry, that file is tracked, and a pointer archived there freezes the heading it names
 * forever, because renaming the section would red this gate on a published record nobody
 * may hand-edit. Reference a section by title in a changeset, never by anchor.
 *
 * SECURITY: the one subprocess call uses execFileSync with array args. No shell form.
