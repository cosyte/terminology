/**
 * scripts/attw.mjs — the `attw` publish gate, made to report its own failure.
 *
 * ▶ THIS FILE IS THE ONE AUTHORITATIVE DESCRIPTION OF THE GATE. The changeset, the
 *   CHANGELOG entry and this repo's `CLAUDE.md` point here rather than restating
 *   the rules, deliberately: the previous shape of this guard was described in
 *   several committed files at once, and every drift between those copies was a
 *   claim that had been edited in some of them and not the others. Edit this
 *   docblock; leave the pointers alone.
 *
 * ▶ WHY THIS WRAPPER EXISTS: `attw` PRINTS "This package does not contain types."
 *   AND EXITS 0. That is not a bug in `attw` — an untyped package is a legitimate
 *   npm package, so the CLI treats "no types at all" as a *description*, not a
 *   problem. From `@arethetypeswrong/cli@0.18.4`,
 *   `node_modules/@arethetypeswrong/cli/dist/getExitCode.js`, first statement:
 *
 *       export function getExitCode(analysis, opts) {
 *           if (!analysis.types) {
 *               return 0;
 *           }
 *
 *   The problem list is consulted only *after* that early return, so no
 *   `--profile`, `--ignore-rules` or config setting can reach it. For a package
 *   that ships types, "does not contain types" does not mean "fine, untyped" —
 *   it means THE TYPES WERE NOT IN THE TARBALL, which is a broken publish. The
 *   gate said nothing, and its caller read the 0.
 *
 * ▶ WHAT IT COST. On 2026-08-01, under a six-worker parallel run, this repo's
 *   `verify.sh` printed "✓ verify green" on a run where `attw` reported "does not
 *   contain types". The propagation in `verify.sh` is sound — it fails on any
 *   non-zero step — so the leak was here, at the step: `attw` complained and
 *   exited 0. A false red costs an hour; A FALSE GREEN MERGES.
 *
 * ▶ THE RACE ONLY SUPPLIES THE CONDITION; IT IS NOT THE DEFECT. Reproduced
 *   deterministically on a quiet box, no concurrency involved, both states:
 *
 *       rm -rf dist && pnpm attw                    -> "does not contain types", exit 0
 *       rm -f dist/index.d.ts dist/index.d.cts && pnpm attw
 *                                                   -> "does not contain types", exit 0
 *
 *   The second is the realistic one: `tsup` emits JS in one pass and the
 *   declaration files in a later pass, so there is a window in every build where
 *   `dist/` holds `.mjs`/`.cjs` and no `.d.ts`. That window is SECONDS, NOT
 *   MILLISECONDS, and no width is quoted here on purpose — independent
 *   measurement sets across this ecosystem disagreed with each other, and the
 *   figure this file used to quote described one box on one day. A concurrent
 *   build or `pnpm clean` in the same working tree lands `attw` in that window.
 *   Which is why this is not answered with a lock or a build queue: the gate is
 *   supposed to be able to tell you its own inputs were missing, whatever removed
 *   them.
 *
 * ▶ TWO NETS, and they catch different things — keep both:
 *
 *   1. PREFLIGHT (structural, no string matching). Every relative artifact path
 *      `package.json` promises — `main`, `module`, `types`, `typings`, `bin`, and
 *      every string leaf of `exports` — must exist and be non-empty before `attw`
 *      runs. This is the one that catches the observed race, and it names the
 *      missing file instead of leaving the reader to infer it.
 *
 *      TWO THINGS IT USED TO WALK PAST, both closed here. (a) `bin` was never
 *      read, so a package could ship a manifest promising a command that is not in
 *      the tarball and this gate would say nothing — `attw` never looks at `bin`
 *      at all. This package declares no `bin` today; the half is here because this
 *      file is the shape every sibling copies, and it is pinned on a fixture that
 *      does declare one. (b) A path written WITHOUT a leading `./` was skipped,
 *      silently. `"types": "dist/index.d.ts"` is legal and is the spelling npm's
 *      own documentation uses, so that dropped a real promise while the gate still
 *      reported it had checked. `exports` leaves are different and are left alone:
 *      Node requires `./` there, so a leaf without it is not a path of ours.
 *
 *   2. POST-CHECK. If `attw` still reports an untyped package, fail. The preflight
 *      cannot see this case: the declaration files can be present on disk and
 *      still be absent from the tarball, because `files` (or `.npmignore`) left
 *      them out. No instance of that is on record in this repo — it is the case
 *      `attw --pack` exists to catch, and the whole point here is that it catches
 *      it silently.
 *
 *   The post-check matches `attw`'s untyped sentence, which is a plain, un-chalked
 *   string in `dist/render/untyped.js`. That makes it blindable, so the arguments
 *   and config that would blind it are REFUSED — see BLINDING below.
 *   `test/scripts/attw-gate.test.ts` pins both nets against the real binary, so if
 *   an `attw` upgrade reworks the wording or fixes the exit code, the suite reds
 *   and tells you to revisit this file rather than letting the net go quietly
 *   slack.
 *
 * ▶ WHAT THE PREFLIGHT CANNOT CONCLUDE, AND WHY IT NO LONGER TRIES. This script
 *   used to end its preflight failure with a sentence naming the exit code `attw`
 *   "would have" produced. It is gone rather than reworded, because THE PREFLIGHT
 *   READS THE MANIFEST AND NEVER THE TARBALL, and the tarball is what decides.
 *   `analysis.types` comes from `containsTypes()` in `@arethetypeswrong/core`'s
 *   `createPackage.js`, which is `listFiles(directory).some(ts.hasTSFileExtension)`
 *   — ANY TypeScript-extension file in the PACKED TARBALL, not the set `exports`
 *   declares, and computed before any entrypoint is resolved. So a package whose
 *   `files` packs a whole `dist/` can lose every DECLARED declaration and still
 *   hand `attw` an undeclared chunk declaration to find, at which point it exits 1
 *   and any "would have exited 0" sentence here is false. A partial loss `attw`
 *   catches by itself; only a total one is the false green. A gate that reds
 *   correctly and then explains itself with a falsehood teaches the next reader
 *   the wider, wrong story, and this file gets copied.
 *
 * ▶ BLINDING, AND WHY THE ARGUMENT GUARD IS AN ALLOW-LIST RATHER THAN A DENY-LIST.
 *   Measured here, against this repo's pinned binary, on a package whose tarball
 *   carries no types — each of these restores the exact false green by making the
 *   untyped sentence absent from what this script can read, while `attw` exits 0:
 *
 *       --quiet / -q            output empty, exit 0
 *       --format json / -f json sentence absent, output NOT empty, exit 0
 *       -fjson / -Pf json / -Pfjson
 *                               same, exit 0 — a value fused to a short flag, and
 *                               a short flag inside a cluster
 *       --config-path <real file> setting quiet or format
 *                               sentence absent, exit 0
 *       .attw.json {"quiet":true} or {"format":"json"}
 *                               sentence absent, exit 0 (readConfig() applies it
 *                               after argv)
 *       --help / -h / --version / -V
 *                               exit 0, output NOT empty, no sentence — the gate
 *                               cannot tell either from a pass
 *
 *   THE DENY-LIST THIS FILE SHIPPED WITH DID NOT HOLD, AND IT WAS NOT ONE MISSING
 *   SPELLING. It refused a fixed set of tokens by `arg.split("=")[0]`, which is
 *   token equality rather than option-name matching, so `-fjson` was neither `-f`
 *   nor `--format` and walked straight through. `-q` in a cluster was caught only
 *   by the empty-transcript net below, which cannot backstop `-f` at all because
 *   JSON output is not empty. `--help` and `--version` were invisible to both
 *   halves. Enumerating spellings buys exactly one more evasion per round.
 *
 *   So the guard is total instead: an ALLOW-LIST of the two arguments this gate's
 *   own callers pass. Everything else is refused, including a
 *   `--format table-flipped` that would blind nothing — "harmless" is a judgement
 *   this script cannot make from an option name, and being over-strict about an
 *   argument nobody passes to a repo's own publish gate costs less than a route
 *   back to a false green. `--config-path` and every future spelling fall out of
 *   this for free rather than needing a line each. Widening the set is a
 *   deliberate one-line edit.
 *
 *   NEITHER ALLOWED ARGUMENT IS PASSED BY THIS PACKAGE'S OWN `attw` SCRIPT, AND
 *   BOTH SENTENCES DESCRIBING THEM WERE WRONG WHEN PORTED — check them here, not
 *   against a sibling.
 *     `--profile` selects the resolution profile. `package.json` passes none, so
 *     the gate runs `attw`'s default `strict`; several sibling manifests DO pass
 *     `--profile node16`, and the suite passes a profile to prove the value is
 *     forwarded rather than dropped. Its value is bounded by `attw` itself, which
 *     rejects anything outside its own choices.
 *     `--no-definitely-typed` suppresses the DefinitelyTyped lookup, which only
 *     exists on the `--from-npm` path; on `--pack` — the path this gate always
 *     takes — it is INERT. It is allowed because this repo's test suite passes it,
 *     and nothing else does.
 *
 *   BOTH ARE PINNED AS FORWARDED, EACH ON ITS OWN. `--profile` is measurable
 *   through `attw`'s own answer, because the profile changes that answer. INERT
 *   MEANS UNOBSERVABLE, so `--no-definitely-typed` is not: accepting it and then
 *   dropping it on the floor looks identical from outside, and it rides along on
 *   every run the suite makes, which is why nothing noticed.
 *   `test/scripts/attw-gate.test.ts` therefore reads the argv off an `attw` shim.
 *   THE CONTROL BESIDE IT IS WHAT CARRIES THE WEIGHT: given no arguments the shim
 *   must see `--pack .` and nothing else, which reds a gate that hard-codes the
 *   flag rather than forwarding it, and which a positive assertion alone cannot
 *   tell apart. A second control asserts that a refused argument never reaches
 *   the shim at all. That one SHARPENS the refusal cases rather than standing in
 *   for them: a gate forwarding its whole argv is already caught, many ways over,
 *   by the refusals themselves.
 *
 *   The `.attw.json` refusal stays, because it is not an argument: `readConfig()`
 *   applies it after argv, so no argument guard of any shape can reach it.
 *
 *   ▶ AND THAT REFUSAL IS NAME-SCOPED WHERE `readConfig()` IS NOT — A KNOWN LIMIT,
 *   FILED RATHER THAN CLOSED. It predates the allow-list, and the allow-list
 *   closes only its argv half (`--definitely-typed` on argv is now refused, where
 *   the deny-list forwarded it); the config route below is untouched.
 *   `readConfig()` calls `setOptionValueWithSource` for EVERY key except
 *   `configPath`/`help`/`version`, so a committed `.attw.json` reaches
 *   options this script does not name — `definitelyTyped` pointed at a `.tgz`, for
 *   one, which merges those types in and can make an untyped tarball analyse as
 *   typed. It needs a committed config file, which is a reviewable artifact rather
 *   than an argv nobody reads. Do not answer it by adding a key: that is the
 *   deny-list this file just retired on the argument side, and the total form
 *   (refuse a `.attw.json` outright) is a behaviour change for callers who
 *   legitimately have one, which is a decision, not a fix.
