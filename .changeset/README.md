# Changesets

This folder is managed by [Changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets). Changesets drives
the **version bump**, the **changelog** and the **publish** for `@cosyte/terminology`. `config.json`
names a `changelog` generator, so the release writes its own version heading into `CHANGELOG.md` and
**your changeset summary is the entry a reader sees there**. Write it for a consumer, and do not
hand-edit `CHANGELOG.md`: everything above its `Released before this file was generated` heading is
generated output.

Two shapes to avoid in a summary, both measured on real releases:

- **No heading at the start of a line**: neither `##` (with up to three leading spaces, which
  CommonMark still reads as a heading) nor a setext underline (`===` or `---` under a line of text).
  Continuation lines are indented by exactly two spaces, which is the content column of the entry's
  own bullet, so such a line becomes a real heading nested inside the release section, permanently,
  once published. Use an inline code span instead.
- **Keep the opening sentence under the release-notes cap**, because it becomes the release bullet
  and the notes gate refuses rather than trims.

Add a changeset for every meaningful change:

```bash
pnpm changeset
```

During pre-alpha, pick **patch**: that keeps the package on the `0.0.x` ladder until its first
alpha. See the cosyte version ladder in the meta-repo's `documentation/conventions.md`.
