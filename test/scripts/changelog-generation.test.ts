/**
 * Tests for the CHANGELOG generation contract: `.changeset/config.json` plus the
 * shape of `CHANGELOG.md` that makes generated output land where a reader expects
 * it.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. `CHANGELOG.md` is listed in `package.json#files`, so it is
 * inside every published tarball of this package. For the whole of its published
 * history the release wrote no version heading into it, because
 * `.changeset/config.json` set `"changelog": false`. The file was hand-maintained
 * under one `[Unreleased]` heading that nothing ever rolled over, so it mixed
 * already-shipped entries in with entries that had not gone out and gave a reader
 * no way to tell which was which — while the package published its way past
 * `0.0.10` on top of it. That is not a mislabelling to correct by hand: correcting
 * the headings leaves the mechanism that produced them, and it drifts again on the
 * next release. The flag is what these tests hold down.
 *
 * WHAT EACH TEST PINS, AND WHY IT IS HERE:
 *
 *  1. The flag itself. `changelog` must name a generator that really resolves and
 *     really exports the two functions Changesets calls. `false` is a legal value
 *     that silently produces no version heading at all, which is the state this
 *     work replaced.
 *  2. That the release actually reaches the generator. The `version` script is a
 *     chain, and `changeset version` is the only link in it that writes a
 *     changelog. A future edit that reorders or drops that link turns the flag
 *     into decoration with nothing else going red.
 *  3. THE DEFECT, ASSERTED DIRECTLY: no `[Unreleased]` heading and no
 *     `[Unreleased]` link definition survive in the file, and its preamble no
 *     longer describes the file as hand-maintained or the generator as off. With
 *     generation on, a surviving hand-maintained `[Unreleased]` heading is worse
 *     than before, not better: the generated version section is prepended ABOVE
 *     it, leaving already released content sitting under "Unreleased" forever, in
 *     the tarball.
 *  4. That the file is still shipped. If it ever leaves `files`, the assertions
 *     above are still nice to have but stop being about a consumer-visible defect,
 *     and the next reader deserves to be told which it is.
 *  5. END TO END, AGAINST THE REAL TOOL. The repo's real `CHANGELOG.md` and real
 *     `.changeset/config.json` are copied into a throwaway package, a synthetic
 *     changeset is added, and the real `changeset version` is run. A test that
 *     reimplements where Changesets inserts text proves only that the test agrees
 *     with itself, and would keep passing through the upgrade that moved it. The
 *     released document must satisfy the shape rule TOO, and the archived history
 *     must come through byte identical: a rule that only held before the first
 *     release would wedge this repo the first time this configuration worked.
 *     The throwaway package is a real git repo, which is not tidiness: the default
 *     generator prefixes each entry with the short sha of the commit that added the
 *     changeset, so without history every case here would assert against a line
 *     shape (`- <summary>`) that no release actually writes.
 *  6. THE PREFIX COLLISION, ON THIS PACKAGE'S OWN LADDER, AND THE TWO CONSECUTIVE
 *     RELEASES THAT EXPOSE IT. `## 0.0.1` is a prefix of `## 0.0.10`. THIS PACKAGE
 *     IS AT `0.0.10` RIGHT NOW, so the collision lands on the very next release
 *     rather than at some future version: any check written with `String.indexOf`
 *     or a substring `toContain` over a version heading reports a heading the
 *     document does not have. The case proves it rather than asserting it: on a
 *     document whose only version heading is `## 0.0.10`, a substring search for
 *     `## 0.0.1` returns TRUE while the exact heading list correctly does not
 *     contain it. Every version-heading comparison in this file is an exact match
 *     against that list for that reason.
 *  7. A CONTROL PROVING THE FLAG IS LOAD-BEARING. The same inputs with
 *     `"changelog": false` must produce NO version heading and leave the document
 *     byte identical. Without this, case 5 would pass on a config change that did
 *     nothing.
 *  8. THE PRETTIER PASS IS LEFT ON HERE, AND THAT IS DERIVED FROM THIS REPO'S OWN
 *     CONFIG RATHER THAN COPIED FROM A SIBLING. Changesets runs the document it
 *     writes through Prettier unless `"prettier": false` turns the pass off, and
 *     the right answer differs per repo — four sibling repos reached it three
 *     different ways. THIS REPO HAS NO `.prettierignore` AT ALL AND ITS
 *     `format:check` GLOBS `"*.{json,md,yml}"`, so `CHANGELOG.md` is inside the
 *     repo's own formatting gate and its archived history is already
 *     Prettier-canonical. Both arms are measured below:
 *
 *       - WITH THE PASS ON, the archived history comes through a release BYTE
 *         IDENTICAL. That is the arm that matters. A sibling whose
 *         `.prettierignore` lists `*.md` had a history that was never
 *         Prettier-canonical, and leaving the pass on there rewrote around 1,240
 *         lines of already-published text and ate the spaces around a backticked
 *         literal inside a bold span. Text corruption inside a permanent tarball is
 *         not a formatting preference. Measured here: zero bytes move.
 *       - WITH THE PASS OFF, the generator's raw output is NOT Prettier-canonical
 *         even for the simplest possible summary — it writes `## <version>` and
 *         `### Patch Changes` on adjacent lines with no blank line between them —
 *         and this repo's own `format:check` rejects that document.
 *
 *     AND THE HONEST QUALIFIER, MEASURED HERE RATHER THAN INHERITED, BECAUSE IT IS
 *     WHERE THIS REPO DIVERGES FROM TWO OF ITS SIBLINGS. THIS repo's `version`
 *     script runs its own `prettier --write` over `CHANGELOG.md` as a later link in
 *     the chain, so with the pass off that second pass would repair the raw output
 *     and the Version PR would NOT open red. So the reason to leave the pass ON
 *     here is NOT "otherwise CI reds". It is that with the pass off, a canonical
 *     published changelog rests entirely on `CHANGELOG.md` staying inside that one
 *     `prettier --write` argument list, which nothing pins and which two of the
 *     nearest sibling repos do not even have; and that with the pass on it costs
 *     nothing, because the archive is byte identical either way. DO NOT RESYNC THIS
 *     VALUE BETWEEN REPOS. Derive it from the repo in front of you, and re-measure
 *     both arms if the `version` script changes.
 *  9. THE SHAPE RULE, and the negative control that explains it. Changesets
 *     prepends by replacing the FIRST newline in the file, so exactly one line can
 *     sit above generated output. The rule is that NOTHING BUT THE H1 sits above
 *     the first heading, which is what makes the splice land between two headings
 *     instead of cutting a paragraph in half. It is deliberately not "the archive
 *     heading comes second": a release puts its own version heading there, so that
 *     assertion would wedge the first Version PR this configuration ever opens.
 *     The control reproduces the damage on the shape this file used to have, so the
 *     rule is demonstrated rather than asserted.
 * 10. THE WRONG-PACKAGE NEGATIVE CONTROL. A changeset that names a package this
 *     repo does not contain must not write an entry into this changelog. Without
 *     it, every green case above is consistent with a generator that writes
 *     whatever it is handed regardless of which package the changeset was for.
 * 11. A CHECK ON EVERY PENDING CHANGESET FOR A LINE THE RELEASE WOULD TURN INTO A
 *     HEADING. Summary continuation lines are indented two spaces, which is the `- `
 *     bullet's own content column, so a heading line inside a summary becomes a real
 *     heading nested in the release section, permanently once published. Neither
 *     Changesets nor the release-notes gate looks, so the check lives here, and it
 *     reads the changesets pending RIGHT NOW rather than what the last release
 *     consumed. IT IS NAMED FOR WHAT IT CHECKS, NOT "a changeset cannot smuggle a
 *     heading": the class is open, a refuter on a sibling reproduced two bypasses of
 *     a column-0-only draft (a leading space, and a setext underline carrying no `#`
 *     at all), and both are closed by `headingLikeLines` below rather than by the name.
 *
 * WHAT THIS FILE DOES NOT CLAIM. It says nothing about the CONTENT of the archived
 * half beyond that a release leaves it alone. The claim that the archive is byte
 * identical to what installed copies hold is a claim about the REGISTRY, and it was
 * measured against the published tarball (`npm pack @cosyte/terminology@0.0.10`,
 * 110,316 bytes, identical to the file at the parent commit) rather than against
 * git — a sibling's draft made that claim from the working tree and was wrong,
 * because an entry had landed after its version commit and never shipped.
 *
 * Every case runs in a temp directory built from scratch, and every mutation
 * happens there: nothing here writes into the repo, bumps its version, or consumes
 * a real changeset. Unlike `test/scripts/phi-scan.test.ts`, whose temp trees have
 * to sit under `test/` because the walk root is what that file proves, these trees
 * belong in the OS temp directory: they contain a `CHANGELOG.md` and a throwaway
 * `package.json` and have nothing to say to the PHI walk roots.
 *
 * The temp tree links this repo's Prettier and its Prettier config in, and that is
 * load-bearing rather than tidy: Changesets resolves Prettier from the tree it is
 * writing into and falls back to its own bundled copy when it finds none, so a run
 * without the links would exercise a formatter and a config that no release of this
 * package has ever used, and case 8 would prove nothing about what really lands on
 * a Version PR.
 *
 * MEASURED WHILE BUILDING THIS, AND WORTH KNOWING BEFORE DEBUGGING A RELEASE:
 * Changesets wraps the changelog write in a try/catch that only `console.warn`s.
 * A tree where `package.json` declares a Prettier config that cannot be resolved
 * bumps the version, consumes the changeset, and writes NO changelog at all, with
 * a warning as the only signal. WHATEVER THE CAUSE, A RELEASE THAT PUBLISHES WITH
 * AN UNCHANGED CHANGELOG IS A WRITE FAILURE, NOT A FLAG THAT QUIETLY REVERTED.
 *
 * TIMEOUTS ARE PER-TEST HERE, DELIBERATELY. `vitest.config.ts` sets no global
 * `testTimeout` and restoring one is a regression; every case below that spawns a
 * subprocess declares its own budget next to the work it pays for.
 *
 * SECURITY: every subprocess call uses spawnSync with array args. No exec, no
 * shell-form.
