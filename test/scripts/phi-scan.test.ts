/**
 * Unit tests for scripts/phi-scan.ts — the STARTER PHI commit-gate.
 *
 * These exercise the SHARED MACHINERY and the cross-cutting SSN/email FLOOR that
 * ships with the template. They deliberately do NOT test structured, field-level
 * PHI detection — that is format-specific and is the author's obligation to add
 * (see the STARTER banner in scripts/phi-scan.ts). When you add structured
 * detectors, add positive tests here proving they CATCH real-looking names /
 * DOBs / ids for this standard — a weak scanner is worse than none.
 *
 * The scanner is invoked via spawnSync (array args, no shell) so the full CLI
 * path (argv parse, exit code, stderr) is exercised. Violator/clean files are
 * written to a throwaway temp dir so they never pollute the committed corpus.
 *
 * SECURITY: every subprocess call here uses spawnSync with array args. No exec,
 * no shell-form.

 * WHY THE SWEEP SPAWNS `node` AND NOT `tsx`, THOUGH `pnpm phi-scan` USES `tsx`.
 *
 * This file spawns the scanner once per case, and the cost of every one of those
 * spawns is start-up, not scanning — the fixtures are a few hundred bytes each.
 * Measured on this box (2026-08-03, 12-CPU cgroup quota, 10 warmed runs each,
 * same scanner, same argv): a `tsx` start had a **median of 500 ms** against
 * **141 ms** for `node` running the same TypeScript through its native type
 * stripping. That is a fixed ~360 ms tax per case, and it is the reason this file
 * was the second-largest in the suite.
 *
 * Nothing under test changes: `node` and `tsx` hand the scanner the same argv, the
 * same cwd and the same stdio, and node's stripping emits no warning to pollute
 * stderr — which matters here, because several cases assert on stderr exactly.
 * Both were checked to produce byte-identical stdout/stderr and the same exit code
 * on a clean file (0) and on a violator (1) before this was changed.
 *
 * TWO THINGS THIS COSTS, AND HOW EACH IS PAID:
 *   - the `tsx` entry point itself is no longer exercised by the sweep, so ONE
 *     test below still spawns `tsx` explicitly to pin the real `pnpm phi-scan`
 *     path. Delete that test and a tsx-only breakage ships silently.
 *   - node's type stripping is on by default from **Node 22.18**, while
 *     `engines.node` here is `>=22.0.0`. CI runs the 22 + 24 matrix, both of which
 *     resolve above that, so CI is unaffected; a developer on 22.0–22.17 running
 *     the suite locally would need a newer 22. Stripping is erased-types-only, and
 *     the scanner uses no TypeScript construct that needs emit, which the
 *     tsx-pinned test reds if it ever stops being true.
